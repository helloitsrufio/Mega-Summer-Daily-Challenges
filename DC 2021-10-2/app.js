// You need to create a function that when provided with a triplet, returns the index of the numerical element that lies between the other two elements.

// The input to the function will be an array of three distinct numbers.

// For example:

// gimme([2, 3, 1]) => 0
// 2 is the number that fits between 1 and 3 and the index of 2 in the input array is 0.

// Another example (just to make sure it is clear):

// gimme([5, 10, 14]) => 1
// 10 is the number that fits between 5 and 14 and the index of 10 in the input array is 1.









// Hint: spread array, sort it and grab the middle value. Throw that into indexOf the array itself
