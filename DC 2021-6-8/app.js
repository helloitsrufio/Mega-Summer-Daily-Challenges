//Find the greatest common divisor of two positive integers. The inputs x and y are always greater or equal to 1, so the greatest common divisor will always be an integer that is also greater or equal to 1.

//will always be positive. Will alawys be greater than or equal to 1. Always numbers? Any edge cases I should consider?
//we want the greatest common divisor of two given integers
