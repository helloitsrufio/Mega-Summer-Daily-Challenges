// Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.
//arr of nums of any size
//majority means that you'll have one num that has more instances than any other one num.

// The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [3,2,3]
// Output: 3
// Example 2:

// Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
// Output: 2
