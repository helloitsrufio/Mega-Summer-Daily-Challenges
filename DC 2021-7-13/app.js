//Tbh I have no idea how to do this one. I missed the class explanation and can't look up the solns on codewars because it's 5kyu and I'm 7kyu. It's too far above my rank. I feel shitty about not being able to solve it, but also I do take some comfort in its difficulty because of course I am having a hard time solving it! It's 5kyu!

//I hope to return to this when my skill is higher.
